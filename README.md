# ClassifierCompare
This is a test of several classifiers on the ionosphere dataset.
• Decision Trees
• Perceptron (usually specified as a neural net with 0 hidden layers)
• Neural Net
• Deep Learning
• SVM
• naïve Bayes
• Logistic Regression
• k-Nearest Neighbors
• Bagging
• Random Forests
• AdaBoost
• Gradient Boosting

the datafile had 34 inputs and those inputs are not linear related to each other. It is a very complicated model. 
SVM has the highest accuracy within those non-ensembled classifiers. That is the reason Bagging with SVM has the highest accuracy.
